      Once upon a <em>time</em> there was a <a href="The_second_one.html">boy</a> called <strong>
      Zaur</strong>, who started to learn web-programming. He was very interested in mastering this subject.

          My father's family name being <span class="tooltip-button"><span>Pirrip</span><span class="tooltip">
          Not my full name, but I will tell you later about it</span></span>, and my christian name Philip, my
          infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip,
          and came to be called Pip.
          <br/>
          I give Pirrip as my father's <span class="tooltip-button">family name<span class="tooltip">Again, the
          information cannot be confirmed, though wished to be</span></span>, on the authority of his tombstone
          and my sister – Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never
          saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies
          regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my
          father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character
          and turn of the inscription, "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that my mother
          was freckled and sickly.

        <p>
          To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
          their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine – who gave up trying to get a
          living exceedingly early in that universal struggle – I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained
          that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken
          them out in this state of existence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first
          most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things, seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw
          afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain, that this bleak place overgrown with
          nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above,
          were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the
          aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected
          with dykes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden
          line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing, was the sea; and
          that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.
